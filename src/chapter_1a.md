# What is `main`?

`main` is a function like this:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

It takes a variety of types of data:

 - Integers, booleans, actual strings, etc.
 - Enums, subcommands, etc.
 - Files, network connections, services, etc.

However, these are all communicated as strings.
