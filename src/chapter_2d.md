# Signatures

Functions have signatures.

Programs are functions.

What is the signature of a native program?
 - The binary doesn't say.
 - The OS doesn't know.
 - The shell doesn't know (in general).

Unix imposes a single effective signature on all programs.

Typed Main lets programs declare their signatures.
